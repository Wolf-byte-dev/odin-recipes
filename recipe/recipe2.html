            <h3>For cooking</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>2 tbsp oil , separated (vegetable, canola or peanut)</li>
                <li>3 garlic cloves , minced</li>
                <li>1 small brown onion , diced</li>
                <li>1 1/2 cups (375 ml) water</li>
                <li>2 tbsp brown sugar</li>
                <li>1 tbsp whole black pepper (sub 2 tsp coarse cracked pepper)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Serving:</h3>
            <ul>            
                <li>2 green onions/scallions , sliced (garnish)</li>
            </ul>

        <h2> Instructions </h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine Chicken and Marinade ingredients in a bowl. Marinate for at least 20 minutes, or up to overnight.</li>
            <li>Heat 1 tbsp oil in a skillet over high heat. Remove chicken from marinade (reserve marinade) and place in the pan. Sear both sides until browned â€“ about 1 minute on each side. Do not cook the chicken all the way through.</li>
            <li>Remove chicken skillet and set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat the remaining oil in skillet. Add garlic and onion, cook 1 1/2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the reserved marinade, water, sugar and black pepper. Bring it to a simmer then turn heat down to medium high. Simmer 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add chicken smooth side down. Simmer uncovered for 20 to 25 minutes (no need to stir), turning chicken at around 15 minutes, until the sauce reduces down to a thick jam-like syrup.</li>
            <li>If the sauce isn't thick enough, remove chicken onto a plate and let the sauce simmer by itself - it will thicken much quicker - then return chicken to the skillet to coat in the glaze.</li>
            <li>Coat chicken in glaze then serve over rice. </li>
        </ol>
