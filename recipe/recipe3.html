            <li>1 tablespoon canola oil</li>
            <li>1 small onion, peeled and sliced thinly</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, peeled and minced</li>
            <li>Â½ pound small shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon shrimp paste</li>

            <li>1 bunch spinach, stems trimmed</li>
        </ul>
        <h2> Instructions </h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Shuck the corn cobs by removing the husks and silks. Using a sharp knife, cut the stem ends.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, stand an ear of corn up and using a small knife, thinly cut the kernels off from top to bottom. Rotate the corn when done with each section to get to the next.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, scrape the sides of the cobs using a spoon to extract the remaining pulp and milky juice.</li>
            <li>In a pot over medium heat, heat oil. Add onions and garlic and cook until softened.</li>
            <li>Add shrimp and cook, stirring occasionally, just until color changes.</li>
            <li>Add shrimp paste and continue to cook for about 1 to 2 minutes or until lightly browned.</li>
            <li>Add the cut corn and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 2 to 3 minutes or until corn turns translucent.</li>
            <li>Add water and bring to a boil, skimming scum that floats on top.</li>
            <li>Lower heat, cover, and simmer for about 7 to 10 minutes or until kernels are tender.</li>
            <li>Add scraped corn pulp and juice and stir to distribute. Continue to simmer for about 3 to 5 minutes until soup thickens.</li>
            <li>Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
            <li>Add spinach, pushing down the leaves into the broth. Turn off heat, cover, and allow the residual heat to cook the spinach just until wilted. Serve hot.</li>
        </ol>
